# Sentiment Analysis with XLNet

This repository contains the code and dataset for my research paper on sentiment analysis using fine-tuned XLNet model from Hugging Face. The sentiment analysis was performed on the Kindle book review dataset, and the model achieved an accuracy of 87% after training for 10 epochs.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. In this research project, we utilized XLNet, a powerful pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face, to perform sentiment analysis on the Kindle book review dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Kindle book review dataset, which includes a diverse range of book reviews. Before training the model, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the data distribution, identify patterns, and preprocess the text data.

## Model Fine-Tuning

I have fine-tuned the XLNet model on the Kindle book review dataset to tailor it for sentiment analysis. The fine-tuning process involved training the model for 10 epochs, optimizing hyperparameters, and monitoring performance metrics. The final trained model achieved an accuracy of 87% on the validation set.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com](https://github.com/ds-09/Sentiment-Analysis-XLNet

2. Explore the jupyter notebooks.
   
## Trained Model
The final fine-tuned XLNet model is available in the trained_models/ directory. You can use this model to perform sentiment analysis on your own text data.
